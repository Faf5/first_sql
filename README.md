# first_sql
This is my first exercise project in SQL.
I got this Company database Scheme on a Youtube tutorial on SQL from Freecodecamp.
Here is the Title SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners.
So I wanted to challenge myself to Create the tables, insert the data and query the data.
I also want to experiment with this table as much as I can.
